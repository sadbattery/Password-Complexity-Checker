> + `Define regular expressions:` You can create regular expressions to match specific patterns in strings.
> + `Search strings:` You can search for patterns within strings using regular expressions.
> + `Perform pattern matching:` You can use regular expressions to extract specific parts of strings that match a pattern.
> + `Replace text:` You can use regular expressions to find and replace patterns within strings.

## How to Use:
+ Run using [Jupyter NoteBook](https://jupyter.org/) or any Python IDE.
